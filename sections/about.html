        <h3>About Ben</h3>
        <p>I fell in love with coding at the University of Iowa when I made my first game using Java. Now, as a frontend developer, I enjoy creating beautiful, interactive elements from custom designs. I have experience in all aspects of web development - including deployment.</p>
